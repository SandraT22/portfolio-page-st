        <h2>About Me:<h2>
          <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my page! My name is <strong>Sandra</strong> and I am brand new to the coding world. My background is primarily in the field of Early Childhood Education. I started off as a Paraprofessional while I was in college, working for the Los Angeles Unified School District and the Moreno Valley Unified School District. From there I got my first job teaching right after graduation at Limerick Elementary School as an Early Childhood Special Education Teacher. Since then I have also worked as an ECEAP Early Childhood teacher in Vancouver, WA, a Head Start teacher in Portland, OR, and as an Education Site Manager. More recently I have embarked on a journey to face my fears and challenge myself by attending the Epicodus coding bootcamp.Outside of my professional interests, I love to go hiking, camping, reading, and spending time with my loved ones. </p>
          <h3>Here you will find a list of the projects that I have worked on. <span class="red">Clink the links below</span> to view my projects. <em>Thank you!</em></h3>
