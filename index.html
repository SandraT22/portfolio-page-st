                <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my page! My name is <strong>Sandra</strong> and I'm brand new to the coding world. I am a female of color and a first generation Mexican-American. My parents are both immigrants that came to the US in the hope of one day providing their children with a life filled with the opportunities that they never had while growing up. Thanks to their sacrifices I graduated from the University of California Riverside with a BA in History and have had the opportunity to pursue interests, such as art, the outdoors, and now coding! I now have hobbies that my parents never even knew existed, including paddle boarding, camping, and painting.</p> 
              <p>My professional background is primarily in the field of Early Childhood Education. I started off as a Paraprofessional while I was in college, working for the Los Angeles Unified School District and the Moreno Valley Unified School District. From there I got my first job teaching right after graduation at Limerick Elementary School as an Early Childhood Special Education Teacher. Since then I have also worked as an ECEAP Early Childhood teacher in Vancouver, WA, a Head Start teacher in Portland, OR, and as an Education Site Manager. More recently I have embarked on a journey to face my fears and challenge myself by attending the Epicodus coding bootcamp.</p>
