    <h1>Sandra's Portfolio Landing Page</h1>
    <p>About Me:</p>
    <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my page! My name is Sandra and I am brand new to the coding world. My background is primarily in the field of Early Childhood Education. I started off as a Paraprofessional while I was in college, working for the Los Angeles Unified School District and the Moreno Valley Unified School District. From there I got my first job teaching right after graduation at Limerick Elementary School as an Early Childhood Special Education Teacher. Since then I have also worked as an ECEAP Early Childhood teacher in Vancouver, WA, a Head Start teacher in Portland, OR, and as an Education Site Manager. Outside of work I love to go hiking, camping, reading, and spending time with my loved ones. </p>
